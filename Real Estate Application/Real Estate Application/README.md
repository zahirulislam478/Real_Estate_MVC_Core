# Master-Detail Pattern in ASP.NET Core

## Overview

The master-detail pattern is a common and powerful design approach in ASP.NET Core for displaying and managing hierarchical or related data. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a list of items (the "master") and want to display detailed information about a selected item (the "detail").

## Key Advantages of Master-Detail

- **Effective Data Presentation**: It allows you to present complex data structures in a user-friendly and organized manner, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the relationships between data items.

- **Improved User Experience**: Users can quickly access and view detailed information about specific items without navigating to a separate page.

- **Reusability**: You can create reusable components for the master and detail views, which is especially valuable when dealing with similar data structures in multiple parts of your application.

## When to Use the Master-Detail Pattern

The master-detail pattern is ideal for various scenarios, including:

- **Product Listings**: Displaying a list of products and their details in an e-commerce site.

- **Employee Directories**: Showing a list of employees and their profiles in a corporate intranet.

- **Orders and Order Details**: Managing customer orders and displaying details of individual orders.

- **Document Management**: Organizing and accessing documents, files, or folders in a document management system.

- **Customer Records**: Viewing customer information and their associated transactions.

## Anatomy of a Master-Detail Implementation

A typical implementation of the master-detail pattern involves:

1. **Master View**: This is the list or summary view that displays a collection of items. Users can select an item to view its details.

2. **Detail View**: This is the view that shows the detailed information of a selected item from the master view.

3. **Navigation**: Implementing mechanisms to allow users to navigate between items in the master view and to view their details.

4. **Data Binding**: Binding the master and detail views to corresponding data sources, which can be done using view models or direct data retrieval from a database.

## Example Usage

Here's a basic example of how to create and use a master-detail pattern in ASP.NET Core:

### Master View (e.g., Products.cshtml):

```html
<ul>
    @foreach (var product in Model.Products)
    {
        <li>
            <a href="@Url.Action("Details", new { id = product.Id })">@product.Name</a>
        </li>
    }
</ul>
